Purpose
--------------

BUCAutoObject is an NSObject subclass that provides implementations of NSCoding, NSSecureCoding, NSCopying, and -isEqual: based on the object's properties. This means that by inheriting from BUCAutoObject, a the model class can be saved or loaded from a file without you needing to write any additional code.

Of course no automated system can read your mind, so BUCAutoObject does place certain restrictions on how you design your classes; For example, you should avoid using structs that are not already NSCoding-compliant via NSValue.

Use of BUCAutoObject is by no means and all-or-nothing decision. You are free to implement your own NSCoding or NSCopying methods on any class in your project and they will simply override the automatically generated methods.

BUCAutoManagedObject
---------------------

BUCAutoManagedObject is an NSManagedObject subclass that provides the same functionality as BUCAutoObject, except that it does not support NSCopying or override -isEqual:, as NSManagedObjects cannot be safely copied and -isEqual: must not be overridden.

ARC Compatibility
------------------

BUCAutoObject is compatible with both ARC and non-ARC compile targets.

Installation
--------------

Drag the BUCAutoObject.h and .m files into your project, or use Cocoapods.

Security
-------------------

BUCAutoObject supports the NSSecureCoding protocol automatically, and returns YES for the `+supportsSecureCoding` method for all objects by default. In addition to this, assuming you do not override `+supportsSecureCoding` to return NO, BUCAutoObject will automatically throw an exception when attempting to decode a class whose type doesn't match the property it is being assigned to. This makes it much harder for a malicious party to craft an NSCoded  file that, when loaded by your app, will cause it to execute code that you didn't intend it to.

Additional methods
-----------------------------

BUCAutoObject provides the following methods.

    + (NSDictionary *)codableProperties;

This method returns an dictionary containing the names and classes of all the properties of the class that will be automatically saved, loaded and copied when the object is archived using NSKeyedArchiver/Unarchiver. The values of the dictionary represent the class used to encode each property (e.g. NSString for strings, NSNumber for numeric values or booleans, NSValue for structs, etc).

This dictionary is automatically generated by scanning the properties defined in the class definition at runtime. Read-only and private properties will also be coded as long as they have KVC-compliant ivar names (i.e. the ivar matches the property name, or is the same but with a _ prefix). Any properties that are not backed by an ivar, or whose ivar name does not match the property name will not be encoded (this is a design feature, not a limitation - it makes it easier to exclude properties from encoding)

It is not normally necessary to override this method unless you wish to add ivars for coding that do not have matching property definitions, or if you wish to code virtual properties (properties or setter/getter method pairs that are not backed by an ivar). If you wish to exclude certain properties from the serialisation process, you can return them in the `uncodableProperties` method and they will be automatically removed from this dictionary.

Note that this method only returns the properties defined on a particular class and not any properties that are inherited from its superclasses. You *do not* need to call `[super codableProperties]` if you override this method.

    - (NSDictionary *)codableProperties;

This method returns all the codable properties of the object, including those that are inherited from superclasses. You should not override this method - if you want to add additional properties, override the `+codableProperties` class method instead.

    - (NSDictionary *)dictionaryRepresentation;

This method returns a dictionary of the values of all the codable properties of the object. It is equivalent to calling `dictionaryWithValuesForKeys:` with the result of `[[object codableProperties] allKeys]` as the parameter.

    - (void)setWithCoder:(NSCoder *)coder;

This method populates the object's properties using the provided coder object, based on the codableKeys array. This is called internally by the initWithCoder: method, but may be useful if you wish to initialise an object from a coder archive after it has already been created. You could even initialise the object by merging the results of several different archives by calling `setWithCoder:` more than once.

    + (instancetype)objectWithContentsOfFile:(NSString *)path;

This attempts to load the file using the following sequence: 1) If the file is an NSCoded archive, load the root object and return it, 2) If the file is an ordinary Plist, load and return the root object, 3) Return the raw data as an NSData object. If the de-serialised object is not a subclass of the class being used to load it, an exception will be thrown (to avoid this, call the method on `NSObject` instead of a specific subclass).

    - (BOOL)writeToFile:(NSString *)filePath atomically:(BOOL)useAuxiliaryFile;

This attempts to write the file to disk. This method is overridden by the equivalent methods for NSData, NSDictionary and NSArray, which save the file as a human-readable XML Plist rather than an binary NSCoded Plist archive, but the `objectWithContentsOfFile:` method will correctly de-serialise these again anyway. For any other object it will serialise the object using the NSCoding protocol and write out the file as a NSCoded binary Plist archive. Returns YES on success and NO on failure.

BUCAutoObject is heavily based on AutoCoding. It is merely a rearrangement of AutoCoding's code into a class, rather than a category. https://github.com/nicklockwood/AutoCoding
